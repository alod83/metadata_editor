## Introduction
Within the field of Digital Humanities, a great effort has been made to digitise documents and collections in order to build catalogues and exhibitions on the Web. We present **WeME - The Web Metadata Editor**, a Web application for building a knowledge base, which can be used to describe digital documents. WeME can be used by different categories of users: archivists/librarians and scholars. WeME extracts information from some well-known Linked Data nodes, i.e. DBpedia and GeoNames, as well as traditional Web sources, i.e. VIAF.
