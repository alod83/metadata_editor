# Welcome to WeME wiki page!

## Introduction
Within the field of Digital Humanities, a great effort has been made to digitise documents and collections in order to build catalogues and exhibitions on the Web. We present WeME, a Web application for building a knowledge base, which can be used to describe digital documents. WeME can be used by different categories of users: archivists/librarians and scholars. WeME extracts information from some well-known Linked Data nodes, i.e. DBpedia and GeoNames, as well as traditional Web sources, i.e. VIAF.

## Installation
To run WeME on your PC, you need to install a Web Server, i.e. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), and create a database to manage the data. Then, you can download our Dump file, containing the database structure with all the tables.
